# Blue Flamingo Pools

## Description & Background

During my career time at the Nashville Zoo, I worked on all of the filtration and pumphouse management around the park. This consisted of walking the park everyday before the front gates opened up and would check the pool chemistry of all the pools, ponds, and other water features around the zoo. After taking chemistry readings and checking filtration all of this data would be recorded on a clip board in an individual pumphouse around the park. This way of recording had a few flaws, one was that we would never record the data in a single data-base which would require walking to a pumphouse to review data for a supervisor if they requested the info and the other was the unnecessary use of paper that would sometimes get dirty or have poor hand writing from other Technicians that recorded the data. My app aims to allow technicians to add and record daily data to a single data-base. Allowing for easy viewing of what the water chemistry looked like on any given day and could see notes about how a tech handled them that day.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
